Question:
You'll be given two strings a and b, a separator symbol, and you need to print a and b such that a and b are separated by the separator symbol followed by a new line.

Examples:

Input: a = "Hello", b = "World", separator = "@"
Output: Hello@World
Explanation: a and b are printed with the separator symbol in between.

Solution:
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void solve() {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String a = sc.nextLine();
        String b = sc.nextLine();
        String sep = sc.nextLine();
        // Print in the required format and a new line
        System.out.println(a + sep + b);
    }
}
