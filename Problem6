Question:
You are given two string variables a and b, and you have to print a and b with a space between them. However, you must prevent the print statement from providing a new line as the new line will be given by the main driver code.

Examples:

Input: a = "Hello", b = "World"
Output: "Hello World"
Explanation: a and b are printed in a single line and a space separates them.The new line is provided by the driver code.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public void utility(Scanner sc) {
        // code here
        String a = sc.next();
        String b = sc.next();
        System.out.print(a + " " + b);
        
    }
}
